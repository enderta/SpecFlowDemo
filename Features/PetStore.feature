Feature: Petstore API
  As a user of the Petstore API
  I want to perform various operations related to pets
  So that I can manage pet data effectively

  Scenario Outline: Create a new pet
    Given I have the following pet data:
      | name   | category   | status   |
      | <name> | <category> | <status> |
    When I send a POST request to "/pet" with the provided pet data
    Then the response status code should be <statusCode>
    And the response should contain the created pet details

    Examples:
      | name     | category | status      | statusCode |
      | Max | Dog    | available | 200        |
      | Lucy   | Cat    | sold      | 200        |
      | Buddy  | Dog    | pending   | 200        |
      | Luna   | Cat    | available | 200        |
